            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <p><b>Riley Costantino</b> <em>October 26th, 2025</em></p>

            <p><em>Smokey and the Bandit</em> will always remain a personal favorite. If you're looking for older humor,
                romance, and a comedy all in one then you're in the right place.
                From Sheriff Buford T. Justice's improvised lines and jokes, to Jerry Reed's catchy song "East Bound and
                Down" made for this movie. <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i></p>

            <p>The chemistry between all of the characters and the way their jokes come off is hilarious and what makes
                this movie so rewatchable, and it will never get old. This movie promotes a country style of living, but
                also friendship and loyalty to the job.</p>
