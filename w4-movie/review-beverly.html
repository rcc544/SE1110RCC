            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <p><b>Riley Costantino</b> <em>October 26th, 2025</em></p>

            <p><em>Beverly Hills Cop</em> is the perfect combination of action and comedy. It gives you no-nonsense
                police work, but also gives you comedic scenes, especially during action fighting. The movie remains a
                classic, and one of the most beloved cop movies out there!</p>
            <p>This movie also has the well known song "Axel F". The song was heavily popularized by Crazy Frog with
                their radio remix of the song. </p>
